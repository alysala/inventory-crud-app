# Welcome to my Inventory CRUD Application for Supra Coders Z-Prefix Admissions Summer 2023
This application was made with a react frontend, python backend, and mongo DB database.

# Backend
-Change directories into the backend folder by running `cd backend`.
-Run `python -m virtualenv venv` to create a Python virtual environment called venv. This will create a folder with the same name in the backend directory.
-Activate the venv virtual environment.
--On MacOS and Linux systems, run `source venv/bin/activate`
--On Windows Command Prompt, run venv\Scripts\activate.bat
-Further reading can be found here[https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments].
-Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all Python dependencies. 
-Ensure MongoDB Community Edition is active.
--Windows: Run MongoDB Community Edition as a Windows Service
--MacOS: Run MongoDB Community Edition
--Linux: Depends on Linux distribution

# Frontend
-Run `npm install` to install all Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
--For a complete list of dependencies, refer to the package.json file in the project root directory.
- Run `npm start` to run the frontend
